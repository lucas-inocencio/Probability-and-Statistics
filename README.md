# Probability-and-Statistics

This project analyzes real data provided by a medium-sized internet service provider, which includes the upload and download rates (in bps) of two types of devices: 
Smart-TV and Chromecast.

The objective is to apply the theoretical knowledge learned in class and provide a critical analysis of the results found.

This project was made in Python 3.11 using the following libraries: Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy.

It is based on the books: "Probability, Random Processes, and Statistical Analysis" by Hisashi Kobayashi, "Probability, Markov Chains, Queues, and Simulation" by 
William Stewart, and "Probabilidade e Estatística: Quantificando a Incerteza" by João Pinheiro.
